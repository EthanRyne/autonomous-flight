Abstract

The unsupervised depth estimation is the recent trend by utilizing
the binocular stereo images to get rid of depth map ground truth. 
In unsupervised depth computation, the disparity images are generated by training the CNN
with an image reconstruction loss. In this paper, a dual CNN based model is
presented for unsupervised depth estimation with 6 losses (DNM6) with indi
vidual CNN for each view to generate the corresponding disparity map. The
proposed dual CNN model is also extended with 12 losses (DNM12) by utilizing 
the cross disparities. The presented DNM6 and DNM12 models are experimented over KITTI driving and Cityscapes urban database and compared with
the recent state-of-the-art result of unsupervised depth estimation.
