Abstract

Monocular depth estimation is often described as an illposed and inherently ambiguous problem. Estimating depth
from 2D images is a crucial step in scene reconstruction, 3D
object recognition, segmentation, and detection. The problem can be framed as: given a single RGB image as input,
predict a dense depth map for each pixel. This problem is
worsened by the fact that most scenes have large texture and
structural variations, object occlusions, and rich geometric
detailing. All these factors contribute to difficulty in accurate depth estimation. In this paper, we review five papers
that attempt to solve the depth estimation problem with various techniques including supervised, weakly-supervised,
and unsupervised learning techniques. We then compare
these papers and understand the improvements made over
one another. Finally, we explore potential improvements
that can aid to better solve this problem.
