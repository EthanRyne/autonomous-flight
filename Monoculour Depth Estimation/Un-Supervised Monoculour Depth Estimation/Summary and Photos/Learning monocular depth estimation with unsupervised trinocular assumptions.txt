Abstract

Obtaining accurate depth measurements out of a single image 
represents a fascinating solution to 3D sensing.
CNNs led to considerable improvements in this field, and
recent trends replaced the need for ground-truth labels with
geometry-guided image reconstruction signals enabling unsupervised training. 
Currently, for this purpose, state-ofthe-art techniques rely on images acquired with a binocular
stereo rig to predict inverse depth (i.e., disparity) according 
to the aforementioned supervision principle. However,
these methods suffer from well-known problems near occlusions, 
left image border, etc inherited from the stereo setup.
Therefore, in this paper, we tackle these issues by moving to
a trinocular domain for training. Assuming the central image as 
the reference, we train a CNN to infer disparity representations 
pairing such image with frames on its left and
right side. This strategy allows obtaining depth maps not
affected by typical stereo artifacts. Moreover, being trinocular 
datasets seldom available, we introduce a novel interleaved 
training procedure enabling to enforce the trinocular
assumption outlined from current binocular datasets. 
Exhaustive experimental results on the KITTI dataset confirm
that our proposal outperforms state-of-the-art methods for
unsupervised monocular depth estimation trained on binocular 
stereo pairs as well as any known methods relying on
other cues.
