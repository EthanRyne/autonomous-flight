Abstract

Depth information is important for autonomous
systems to perceive environments and estimate their own state.
Traditional depth estimation methods, like structure from motion
and stereo vision matching, are built on feature correspondences
of multiple viewpoints. Meanwhile, the predicted depth maps
are sparse. Inferring depth information from a single image
(monocular depth estimation) is an ill-posed problem. With the
rapid development of deep neural networks, monocular depth estimation based on deep learning has been widely studied recently
and achieved promising performance in accuracy. Meanwhile,
dense depth maps are estimated from single images by deep
neural networks in an end-to-end manner. In order to improve
the accuracy of depth estimation, different kinds of network
frameworks, loss functions and training strategies are proposed
subsequently. Therefore, we survey the current monocular depth
estimation methods based on deep learning in this review.
Initially, we conclude several widely used datasets and evaluation
indicators in deep learning-based depth estimation. Furthermore,
we review some representative existing methods according to
different training manners supervised, unsupervised and semisupervised. Finally, we discuss the challenges and provide some
ideas for future researches in monocular depth estimation.
