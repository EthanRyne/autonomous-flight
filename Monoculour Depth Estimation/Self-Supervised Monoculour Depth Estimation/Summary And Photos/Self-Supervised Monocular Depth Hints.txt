Abstract

Monocular depth estimators can be trained with various forms of 
self-supervision from binocular-stereo data to circumvent the 
need for high-quality laser-scans or other ground-truth data. 
The disadvantage, however, is that the photometric reprojection 
losses used with self-supervised learning typically have multiple 
local minima. These plausible-looking alternatives to ground-truth 
can restrict what a regression network learns, causing it to 
predict depth maps of limited quality. 
As one prominent example, depth discontinuities around thin 
structures are often incorrectly estimated by current 
state-of-the-art methods.
