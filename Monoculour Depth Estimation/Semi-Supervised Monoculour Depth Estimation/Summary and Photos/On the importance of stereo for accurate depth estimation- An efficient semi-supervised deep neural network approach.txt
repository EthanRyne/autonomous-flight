Abstract

We revisit the problem of visual depth estimation in the context 
of autonomous vehicles. Despite the progress on monocular depth 
estimation in recent years, we show that the gap between monocular 
and stereo depth accuracy remains largeâ€”a particularly relevant 
result due to the prevalent reliance upon monocular cameras by 
vehicles that are expected to be self-driving. We argue that the 
challenges of removing this gap are significant, owing to fundamental 
limitations of monocular vision. 
As a result, we focus our efforts on depth estimation by stereo. 
We propose a novel semi-supervised learning approach to training 
a deep stereo neural network, along with a novel architecture 
containing a machine-learned argmax layer and a custom runtime 
that enables a smaller version of our stereo DNN to run on an 
embedded GPU. Competitive results are shown on the KITTI 2015 
stereo dataset. We also evaluate the recent progress of stereo 
algorithms by measuring the impact upon accuracy of various design 
criteria.
