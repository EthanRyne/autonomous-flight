Abstract

Current self-supervised methods for monocular depth estimation are 
largely based on deeply nested convolutional networks that leverage 
stereo image pairs or monocular sequences during a training phase. 
However, they often exhibit inaccurate results around occluded 
regions and depth boundaries. In this paper, we present a simple 
yet effective approach for monocular depth estimation using stereo image pairs. 
The study aims to propose a student-teacher strategy in which a 
shallow student network is trained with the auxiliary information 
obtained from a deeper and more accurate teacher network. 
Specifically, we first train the stereo teacher network by fully 
utilizing the binocular perception of 3-D geometry and then use 
the depth predictions of the teacher network to train the student 
network for monocular depth inference. 
This enables us to exploit all available depth data from massive 
unlabeled stereo pairs. We propose a strategy that involves the 
use of a data ensemble to merge the multiple depth predictions of 
the teacher network to improve the training samples by collecting 
non-trivial knowledge beyond a single prediction. 
To refine the inaccurate depth estimation that is used when training 
the student network, we further propose stereo confidence-guided 
regression loss that handles the unreliable pseudo depth values 
in occlusion, texture-less region, and repetitive pattern. 
To complement the existing dataset comprising outdoor driving scenes, 
we built a novel large-scale dataset consisting of one million 
outdoor stereo images taken using hand-held stereo cameras. 
Finally, we demonstrate that the monocular depth estimation network 
provides feature representations that are suitable for high-level 
vision tasks. 
The experimental results for various outdoor scenarios demonstrate 
the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach, which outperforms 
state-of-the-art approaches.
