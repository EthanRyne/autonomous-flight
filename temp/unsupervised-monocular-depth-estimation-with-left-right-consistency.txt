[1] proposes a training framework that trains a neural networt without ground truth images, they take in use of epipolar geometry constraints. By image reconstruction loss they generate disparity images, and contributes a end to end unsupervised monocular depth estimation with a novel training loss.Their fully connnected architecture is based on dispnet[3] with several modifications, their defined losses are Appearence Matching Loss, Disparity Smoothness Loss, Left-Right Disparity Consistency Loss.
